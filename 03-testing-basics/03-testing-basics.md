# AAA pattern
The AAA pattern is the specific pattern that you should use when writing tests: Arrange, Act, and Assert

# Run tests
run the test with
`npm test`
or
`npm run test`

# Watching tests (keep running tests)
if you run:
`npm run test:watch`
you enter the watch mode: it executes the tests, but it keeps watching the tests files, just like when we run a development server during development, which watches our source code files and therefore also reloads a page if we change the source code.
